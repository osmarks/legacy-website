* [Colours of the Alphabet](/alphacol/) shows you the alphabet's many colours. It could theoretically be extended to the full ASCII char space quite easily.
* [Infinite Lorem Ipsum](/lorem/) is something I decided to make after being inspired by [endless.horse](http://endless.horse).
* [RPNCalc](/calc/) could use a better name and is basically a stack-based calculator. One day it might even do subtraction!
* [AutoScorer](/scorer/) can keep numerical scores during games. It was designed for use handling Monopoly money but is pretty generic.
* [RPNCalc3](/calc3/) is like the RPNCalc above, but better. Now with subtraction! (Note about version numbers: v1 was a command-line program, v2 is the original available here, v3 is this)
