# My collection of experiments
* [Lunar Lander](lander/) is a simple (and somewhat broken currently) moon landing game (note: has no actual aim).
* [Colours of the Alphabet](colours-alpha.html) shows you the alphabet's many colours. It could theoretically be extended to the full ASCII char space quite easily.
* [Infinite Lorem Ipsum](lorem/) is something I decided to make after being inspired by [endless.horse](https://endless.horse).
* [RPNCalc](calc/) could use a better name and is basically a stack-based calculator. One day it might even do subtraction!
* [AutoScorer](scorer/) can keep numerical scores during games. It was designed for use handling Monopoly money but is pretty generic.
* Game of Life is not yet available on this website. It's a simple in-browser F# implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. Source [here](https://gitlab.com/osmarks/game-of-life).
