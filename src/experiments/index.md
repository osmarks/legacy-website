* [Colours of the Alphabet](/cota/) shows you the alphabet's many colours. It could theoretically be extended to the full ASCII char space quite easily.
* [Infinite Lorem Ipsum](/lorem/) is something I decided to make after being inspired by [endless.horse](http://endless.horse).
* [RPNCalc](/old-calc/) could use a better name and is basically a stack-based calculator. One day it might even do subtraction!
* [AutoScorer](/asc/) can keep numerical scores during games. It was designed for use handling Monopoly money but is pretty generic.
* [RPNCalc3](/calc/) is like the RPNCalc above, but better. Now with subtraction! (Note about version numbers: v1 was a command-line program, v2 is the original available here, v3 is this)
* The [Idea Generator](/idea/), home of terrible procedurally-generated ideas.

I also have a bunch of stuff for the Minecraft mods ComputerCraft and OpenComputers.
It can be found here, mostly: [my pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/osmarks).
