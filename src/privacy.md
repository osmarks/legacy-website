When you use this website, the following information is stored until the end of time in our nginx logs:
* requesting IP address
* time of request
* request method
* request URL
* request HTTP version
* response status code
* response length
* referrer header
* user agent header

When you use this website's git hosting, and sign in, this data may also be stored:
* anything you input (including, probably, name, email and password (hashed))

If you want your data to be deleted, please email me at osmarks@protonmail.com and I will attempt to do so, unless your request is really ridiculous and unverifiable.
