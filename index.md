Welcome to my website!
I'm Oliver Marks.
I program a bit in my spare time, and also play games, including Cities: Skylines, Minecraft and KSP.
Unfortunately, I have no clue what should go here, so visit the Experiments page or something.

# Notice
osmarks.ml is going to undergo large internal changes soon, now that a better (i.e. not a raspberry pi) server has been purchased to run it.
This may result in downtime.
